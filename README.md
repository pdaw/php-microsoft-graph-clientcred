PHP Client Credentials with Microsoft Graph
=============================

This is a very simple application example that implements getting any user's calendar using 
Azure Active Directory as the authentication provide. This practice is applicable for services or deamon apps. 
More technical details you may find on 
[documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/authorization/app_only). Keep in mind that you
can use only 1.0 end-points. [Should you use the v2.0 endpoint?](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-limitations) 

Preconditions
------------

*  granted permission (`Read calendars in all mailboxes`) by administrator for Microsoft Graph API
